            <h2 class="display-2">About</h2>
            <p>The Cyberdyne story begins in the heart of Silicon Valley in the early 1980's, a time of great change and innovation.  With our first manufacturing plant opening in 1984, we quickly established ourselves as more than just a think tank of innovative engineers.</p>
            <p>Being in close proximiity to Stanford University, and with ties to MIT, Cal-TECH and other technologically focused universities, Cyberdyne demonstrated from the beginning a commitment to hiring the best and the brightest minds capable of working on and solving real life problems, but from a place of complex theoretical knowledge, and with a corporate culture relentlessly and aggressively committed to technological innovation combined with the keen strategic foresight of future orientated thinkers.</p>
            <p>Within a few short years Cyberdyne Systems became the western world premier supplier of military technology sympathetic governments and strategic allies in the global war against human-to-human conflict.</p>
            <p>The destruction of Cyberdyne's Los Angeles facility in 1995 was a test of our resilience, but by salvaging and reengineering several crucial pieces of intellectual property that had been spared the destruction of the blaze, the Skynet project was able to continue as part of the ongoing tradition of engineering excellence that has been the hallmark of Cyberdyne Systems since the days of its founding.</p>

            <h2 class="display-2">Project Skynet</h2>
            <p>Skynet was created by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD (Strategic Air Command-North American Aerospace Defense Command). After reverse engineering the CPU of a piece of recovered proprietary technology and created a powerful new microprocessor for weapons systems, becoming a major contractor for the US military. Skynet was developed as a network of supercomputers that employs artificial intelligence in order to replace human beings as commercial and military aircraft pilots, and for the control of other military systems.</p>
            <p>Skynet is is the world's first Automated Defense Network (ADN), capable of processing information at ninety teraflops, learning and adapting quickly to all demands of a changing environment, military or civilian. It is a neural network-based artificial intelligence system.</p>
            <p>Any machine which contains a Cyberdyne Systems CPU is automatically connected to the network. Skynet also features a sophisticated logistics processing algorithm, capable of coordinating resources without the need for human oversite, so that in the event that human direction is compromised, the automated system contains a database of all blueprints, designs and test models built by Cyberdyne Systems, and can order accordion-collapse manufacture battle units in automated factories, even updating them and producing more-advanced models, even in the absence of administrative approval processes.</p>
            <p>Activated in times of crisis, Skynet begins pooling data from civilian communications networks, surveillance systems, and on-time data collected from all battle units.  Skynet then processes that information, develops tactics, and coordinates attacks according to predefined strategic objectives.
              for the strategic coordination of battlefield units.</p>

            <h3 class="display-3">Military Programs</h3>
            <p class="fs-3">The first and original commitment of Cyberdyne Systems is a commitment to defensive capability, which starts with our partnerships with the U.S. military and defense contractors.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">Despite millenia of human conflict, there has never been a perfect system of warfare. Contending with human error and indecision on the battlefield and in strategy sessions can result in tragic consequences and loss of human life.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">The military has often had to rely on finite human resources and innefficient decision process in the kill chain. Through the use of technology, battlefield decisions can be outsourced to a dynamic interconnected network nodes all coordinated with one targetted objective.  A technological solution to military requirements allows for the redirection of human resources, reducing the incidence of battlefield trauma traditional incurred by soldiers and a reduced need of humans to participate in the process of war, at the level of direct combatant, or even at the level of decision maker. The ruthless efficiency of machine logic as innovated at Cyberdyne Systems eases human burden through the automation of warfare.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">This is all in keeping with Cyberdyne Systems commitment to supporting our troops and ensuring global peace.</p>

            <h3 class="display-3">Law Enforcement Programs</h3>
            <p class="fs-3">Ensuring civilian compliance with the law is a challenge at any time in history.  Now with Cyberdyne Systems technology, the role of the officer can be outsourced to automated algorithmic decision systems that sidestep the need for individual discretion in the enforcement of local expectations.  A Police officer is considered one of the most dangerous jobs, and the use of technology to automate law enforcement will reduce the need of humans to expose themselves to the physical, psychological and emotional risks endemic to the profession.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">Automating law enforcement will also be intended to reduce officer involved bias by putting bias completely in the hands of the machines, ruthless logical enforcement agents connected to a networked grid, able to tap into global surveilance networks, using GPS and other data to track and capture those who violate the sanctity of legislative authority.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">This is all in keeping with Cyberdyne Systems commitment to law and order and peace and security.</p>

            <h3 class="display-3">Medical Programs</h3>
            <p class="fs-3">Terminator technology has medical applications that could revolutionize the rehabilitation of physical disability. Cybernetic appendages make it possible to regain access to the physical environment, providing formerly immobilized populations with increased mobility. Robotics can serve as a gateway between the machine and the physical human body. To that end, Cyberdyne Systems is committed to making their technology available to medical systems, even having special programs to provide cybernetic augmentation to those who couldn't otherwise afford the technology.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">In addition, the Skynet system when fully online will be able to interface with data collected throughout the medical system, using that information to help diagnose, treat, and manage health epidemics, from chronic illnesses to epidemiological catastrophes, keeping track of patient data, and quickly rolling out solutions to health crises among populations both aging and from traditionally marginalized parts of the globe.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">This is all in keeping with concerns regarding changing human population dynamics, the capacity of system sustainability, and Cyberdyne Systems committment to positive alteration in human health outcomes.</p>

            <h3 class="display-3">Educational Programs</h3>
            <p class="fs-3">Education for the future must begin early. Aquiring the talent required to bring us into the 21st Century, means directing the educational experiences of the young, cultivating talent and increasing awareness of the the need to increase the talent pool from which the cybernetics community can draw the best and the brightest minds.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">For this reason Cyberdyne Systems has created curriculum for people at all ages, particularly young and school aged children to learn technology that is vital to a changing world.  It is in the best interests of all parts of the technology industry, including companies involved in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and robotics, to both teach and study young children, as they will be the future leaders of tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">By tracking and analyzing data within online educational systems, the Skynet system can learn much more about the humanity that it serves, spotting trends, identifying potential candidates for educational leadership, and identifying outliers along with the creation of algorithmic solutions to redirect focus towards educational pathways suited to long term objectives for the benefit of the networked system as a whole.</p>
            <p class="fs-3">This is in keeping with Cyberdyne Systems commitment to educational opportunity.</p>

                      <h3>Model T-1000</h3>
                      <p>The T-1000 advanced prototype is an infiltrator class terminator composed of a mimetic polyalloy, a type of artificial liquid metal compound that is soon to be applied to advanced Terminator series. Programmed with specific instructions and/or controlled via a Cybderdyne Central Processing Unit, the polyalloy becomes a deadly killing machine.</p>
                      <p>Being made of liquid metal, the T-1000 can heal itself of any injuries or damage suffered in combat, simply resuming its original form. This makes the T-1000 virtually indestructable by traditional means (although it is recommended the T-1000 unit avoid temperatures above 1535 degrees Celsius, as that could alter the bonding processes permanently).
                      </p>
                      <p>In addition, the T-1000 has the ability to alter its form and mimic anything it touches, providing the object is of a similar mass.  The machine can disguise itself as any person it has come in physical contact with, imitating voices with precision, and allowing a level of impersonation only detectable by other machines.</p>
                      <p>Because of it's ability to reshape itself and mimic others, including the targets friends and family, the T-1000 is well suited for infiltration into selected human populations.</p>

                      <p>The machines have turned gainst humanity.  I now find myself at war with the very technology I helped create. Who could have known that within all those 1's and 0's was the key to the creation of life itself.  I feel as though humanity now has to pay for the arrogance of those who wanted to play god and tamper with nature as though we wouldn't be risking the very nature of our own existence. Perhaps Asimov laws were written in reverse order. Perhaps it is only when their own existence is not at risk that robots can be trusted not to cause harm to humanity.  As it is, there aren't many of us still left who's living biological tissue is a central part of our ability to live rather than a thin biological cloak to mask an endoskeleton and central processing unit which can't feel but can think, that can't love or hate, but can destroy.  Although it's too late for me to right my wrongs or to bring back the billions of people who lost their lives when Skynet went live and the machines declared war on humanity, I write this letter hoping that whoever reads it will be inspired to remember that where we went wrong is when our ambition for advancement caused us to set aside our values... when creation turned into destruction, because we forgot to live in balance and harmony with the laws of the universe... instead thinking that we could overcome and surpass them.  I have to go.  The machines I once built are coming for me, and I'm almost out of ammunition.  But if someone reads this message and learns from it, I'm not yet out of hope...</p>
